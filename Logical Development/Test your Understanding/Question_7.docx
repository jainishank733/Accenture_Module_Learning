Tony crosses a street that is ‘x’ m long in 'y' minutes. Write an algorithm to compute his speed in km per hour, given x and y.

Hint: speed=distance/time


Start the program.
Get distance and speed.
Convert distance in metre to kilo metre, ie distance = distance/1000.
Convert time in minutes to hours, ie time = time/60. 
Calculate speed = distance/time.
display speed.
stop.
